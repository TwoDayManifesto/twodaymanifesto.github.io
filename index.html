          Each developer in your company should have two days
          per month to work on the open source software your product is
          built on.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section section--explanation">
      <h2>Why should we?</h2>

      <p>
        There is probably more code in your product written by other people for free
        than was written by your developers. Giving something back to the people who
        built this for you is simply the right thing to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        Don't buy that? That's OK. The real reason you should do it is because it
        will make your product better, make your developers better, and make your
        company a more attractive place to work.
      </p>

      <p>Yes, really.</p>

      <p>
        This code is <em>still part of your product</em> and by making it better,
        you make your product better. By taking the time to improve its stability,
        performance, or features, you are also improving your product. If you fix
        a bug in a library you use, that is a bug that you won't later see in
        production. If you improve the performance, that is performance you'll see
        in production. If you develop a feature you need, that will save you time
        when you need to use it in your product.
      </p>

      <p>
        It also gives your developers a way to improve their skills. They become
        more familiar with their tools and their capabilities, and the change of
        perspective will give them new ideas about how to work on the main product.
      </p>

      <h2>How should we?</h2>

      <p>
        Simply schedule it in like you would any other work. Figure out which projects 
        are a priority, decide what you want to work on in them, and then do it.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're not
        sure what tasks you start with, try looking at projects' issue trackers or asking
        their maintainers. You might want to start with smaller projects, as they will
        both be easier to get started with and more accessible to new developers, but
        really any software you use is an option.
      </p>
